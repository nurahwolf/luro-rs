/// Converts an `async-compatible` function into a builder and modifies function's body
/// to parse all required arguments, for further information about the behaviour of this macro, see
/// the implementation.
///
/// By an `async-compatible` function it's meant a function with a minimum of one argument,
/// which must be an `&SlashContext<T>`, which is always given and also used to parse all arguments.
///
/// # Usage:
///
/// This macro can be used two ways:
///
///     - Without arguments, as #[command], which takes the caller function name as the name of the command.
///     - Providing the name, as #[command("command name")] which takes the provided name as the command name.
///
/// When marking a function with this attribute macro, you **must** provide a description of the
/// command that will be seen on discord when using the command, this is made by adding a
/// `description` attribute, which can be added two ways:
///
///     - List way: #[description("Some description")]
///
///     - Named value way: #[description = "Some description"]
///
/// ## Arguments:
///
/// You **must** provide another `description` attribute for every argument describing what they
/// are, this description will be seen on discord when filling up the argument. This needs to be
/// done with all the arguments except the context, which must be the first one, the accepted
/// syntax is the same as the previous `description` one.
///
/// ### Renaming:
/// Adding a `rename` attribute is optional, but can be used to modify the name of the argument seen
/// in discord, it is allowed to have only one `rename` attribute per argument and the attribute can
/// be used the same ways a the `description` one.
///
/// ### Autocompletion:
/// Adding an `autocomplete` attribute is also optional, but it allows the developer to complete
/// the user's input for an argument. This attribute is used the same way as the description one,
/// but it *must* point to a function marked with the `#[autocomplete]` attribute macro.
///
/// ## Specifying required permissions
///
/// It is possible to specify the permissions needed to execute the command by using the
/// `#[required_permissions]` attribute. It accepts as input a list of comma separated
/// [twilight permissions](https://docs.rs/twilight-model/latest/twilight_model/guild/struct.Permissions.html).
/// For example, to specify that a user needs to have administrator permissions to execute a command,
/// the attribute would be used like this `#[required_permissions(ADMINISTRATOR)]`.

/// Implements `Parse` for an enum, allowing it to be used as a command argument.
/// The enum will be seen by the user as a list of options to choose from, and one of the variants
/// will have to be selected.
///
/// # Examples:
///
/// ```rust
/// use zephyrus::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Parse)]
/// enum Choices {
///     First,
///     Second,
///     Third,
///     // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Enums variants can be renamed to modify the value seen by the user using the
/// `#[parse(rename = "<RENAME>")]` attribute.
///
/// # Example:
/// ```rust
/// use zephyrus::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Parse)]
/// enum Choices {
///     First,
///     Second,
///     #[parse(rename = "Forth")]
///     Third, // <- This item will be shown to the user as "Forth", despite its variant name being Third
///     // ...
/// }
/// ```

/// Implements the `Modal` trait for the derived struct, allowing it to create modals and collect
/// the inputs provided by the user.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use zephyrus::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Modal)]
/// struct MyModal {
///     something: String,
///     optional_item: Option<String>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Attributes
///
/// The derive macro accepts several attributes:
///
/// - `#[modal(title = "<TITLE>")]`: This attribute allows specifying the title of the modal, by default the
/// title will be the name of the structure.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// #[derive(Modal)]
/// struct MyModal { // <- This modal will have "MyModal" as title.
///     //...
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Modal)]
/// #[modal(title = "Some incredible modal")]
/// struct OtherModal { // <- This one will have "Some incredible modal" as the title.
///     // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - `#[modal(label = "<LABEL>")]`: This attribute allows setting the label of the field, by default it will
/// be the name of the struct field.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use zephyrus::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Modal)]
/// struct MyModal {
///     #[modal(label = "My field")]
///     something: String, // <- This field will be shown as "My field"
///     optional_item: Option<String> // <- This one will use the struct name "optional_item"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - `#[modal(max_length = x)]` and `#[modal(min_length = y)]`: These attributes allow to set a
/// maximum/minimum amount of characters a field can have.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use zephyrus::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Modal)]
/// struct MyModal {
///     #[modal(max_length = 150, min_length = 15)]
///     something: String, // <- This field will have both maximum and minimum size constraints.
///     #[modal(max_length) = 25]
///     short_field: String, // <- This field will only have a maximum size constraint.
///     optional_item: Option<String> // <- This one won't have any
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - #[modal(placeholder = "<PLACEHOLDER>")]: This attribute allows specifying a placeholder that will be seen
/// before entering anything on the input.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use zephyrus::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Modal)]
/// struct MyModal {
///     #[modal(placeholder = "This is a placeholder")]
///     something: String, // <- This field will have as placeholder "This is a placeholder".
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - `#[modal(paragraph)]`: This attribute will mark the field as a paragraph. By default, all fields are
/// marked as single line fields, so the user will only be able to input up to one line unless we
/// mark it as a paragraph.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use zephyrus::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Modal)]
/// struct MyModal {
///     #[modal(paragraph)]
///     something: String, // <- This field will be shown as a multi-line field.
///     optional_item: Option<String> // <- This one will be shown as a single line one.
/// }
/// ```
