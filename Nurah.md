Multiple profiles for Nurah

## Nurah (F) - Recon Stance

Nurah's preferred feral stance, with an emphasis on endurance. Unless stated, she generally uses her 'fluffy' skin, appearing and feeling as normal fur, instead of her tanky armoured plating.

### SFW Description

Nurah's feral form is large and imposing, with a strong focus on strength, endurance and durability. Unlike her anthro form, she is designed to be able to take punishment and dish it out in turn, and is the only way that she can easily carry her heavier weapons. She also has a soft spot for socialising in this form, and so has a slight habit of springing this form on her friend as a joke.

Unlike her anthro form, her large size allows her body to be more modular. As such, she has two 'skins' which she can swap to, depending on the situation.
- 'Fluffy' skin - A thick layer of synthetic skin and covered in dense, fluffy fur. Each individual hair has complex articulators within it, allowing for fine motor control. It allows her fur to wrap around objects, change in texture and fluffle up at will. Idling, she generally has a 'pulsing' motion flowing through her fur, almost looking like the fur is responding to wind. She mostly looks and feels like a biological, though excluding armour underneath her skin, is not able to take a great deal more punishment than her anthro form.
- 'Tanky' skin - This skin is comprised of several armoured segments that work together to make up the entirety of her body. Absolutely nothing is unprotected, though as a consequence it leaves her looking entirely like a robot. She loses a noticeable amount of dexterity, though gains a ridiculous amount of survivability with the ability to eat up medium arms fire like rifles with ease. For even more survivability she can add on her exo suit as well (Entering her tank stance), though she becomes unwieldy and uncoordinated.

Her genetalia defaults to that of human (human slit), though she is rather fond of presenting with fully accurate genetalia as well, depending on how much she wishes to mess with others.
