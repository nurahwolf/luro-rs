/// Compares the position of two roles.
///
/// This type is used to compare positions of two different roles, using the
/// [`Ord`] trait.
///
/// According to [twilight-model documentation]:
///
/// > Roles are primarily ordered by their position in descending order.
/// > For example, a role with a position of 17 is considered a higher role than
/// > one with a position of 12.
/// >
/// > Discord does not guarantee that role positions are positive, unique, or
/// > contiguous. When two or more roles have the same position then the order
/// > is based on the rolesâ€™ IDs in ascending order. For example, given two roles
/// > with positions of 10 then a role with an ID of 1 would be considered a
/// > higher role than one with an ID of 20.
